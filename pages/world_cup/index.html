      <h3>
        Six Liverpool players will continue their World Cup journeys as the
        tournament's quarter-finals take place on Friday and Saturday.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Alisson and Fabinho (Brazil) Liverpool's No.1 has made three
        appearances at the World Cup to date for his country. Alisson kept two
        clean sheets before conceding his first goal of the tournament in the
        Selecao's emphatic 4-1 knockout victory over South Korea last time
        out. Fabinho has featured once, which came in the final group game
        against Cameroon. Brazil now face 2018 finalists Croatia in their next
        contest as they target a sixth triumph in the tournament.
      </p>
      <p>
        Van Dijk (Netherlands) The centre-back has captained his nation in
        Qatar, helping them into the last eight by making four appearances.
        Louis van Gaal's outfit defeated the USA 3-1 last weekend to become
        the first team to book their spot in the quarter-finals. Van Dijk will
        now face Lionel Messi and Argentina, and said: "It's a quarter-final
        and that brings that extra-special [feeling] to it. For me personally,
        I'm just so proud and happy to be there, lead out the boys and
        hopefully advance to the semi-final and get a step closer to the dream
        that all of us have."
      </p>
      <p>
        Konate (France) The Reds defender will be on the opposite side to
        clubmates Henderson and Alexander-Arnold when the holders meet
        England. Didier Deschamps' men earned a place in the quarter-finals
        via victory over Poland, with Olivier Giroud and Kylian Mbappe
        providing the goals before a late penalty from Robert Lewandowski.
        Konate has appeared three times for Les Bleus so far at the World Cup
